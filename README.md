## Contributing

Open source contributions are greatly appreciated! If you have a bugfix, improvement or new feature, please create
[an issue](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-webpack-devkit/issues/new) first and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-webpack-devkit/pulls/new) against master.

Before you contribute read through the following guidelines.

* The `master` branch contains a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**
* Checkout relevant topic branches, e.g. `develop` and merge back against that branch.
* Your commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) so that changelogs and version bumps can be automatically generated. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `npm run commit` instead of git commit, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.
* We will let GitHub automatically squash your PR before merging, so don't worry about making multiple small commits.

## Development setup

After cloning the repo just install the dependencies and you are good to go.

```
npm i
```
